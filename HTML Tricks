HTML Character Entity References
THESE ARE USED TO HELP DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN HTML COMMANDS AND TEXT PART OF CONTENT ,   AVAOID RENDERING ISSSUES

&lt; - for '<' 
&gt; - for '>' 
&amp; - for '&' 
&copy; - for use copyright symbol
&nnbsp; - make sure that 3 words in an HTML document ALWAYS appear together on 1 line, even if the text word-wraps because the browser window is too narrow for that text line, so 
        place &nbsp; entity reference after the 1st word and after the 2nd word (with no spaces in between words and entity references)
&quote - for ' " ' double quotes
