##Before your first commit, you need to let git know your name and email address. This information will be tied to all of your future commits.
## Use the commands:
 git config --global user.name "Shreyas Gupta"
 git config --global user.email "shreyasgup21@gmail.com
 "
git commit m"My First page."

## To update your local repo to GitHub you used git push command. But if there are any changes occur in GitHub, 
at that situation you have to fetch your data from GitHub and pull all the changes from GitHub

git fetch
git pull    ## ( before pushing again )

git push
## local file/folder moved to Github
